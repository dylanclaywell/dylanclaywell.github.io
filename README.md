It is powered by Solid.js, and uses an GraphQL to communicate with an [Express back-end](https://github.com/dylanclaywell/get-productive-api).

## Local Usage

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
